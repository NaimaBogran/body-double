                Hi, I’m <strong>Naima</strong> — a software engineer who knows how overwhelming
                it can feel to stay consistent on your own. While balancing projects,
                deadlines, and learning, I discovered the power of working alongside someone else.
            </p>

            <p>
                BODY/DOUBLE was created to offer accessible, supportive accountability. A calm
